# Introduction
## Objectives
This is a real-time chat app with Firebase's firestore. I made this app along with this tutorial of [codingthesmartway.com](https://codingthesmartway.com/vue-js-2-and-firebase/) with a week time frame to experience Vue framework. 
I changed the enviroment setup to Vue3, Tailwind for faster load, instead of Vue2, Bootstrap, and JQuery.
