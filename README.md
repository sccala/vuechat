# Introduction
## Objectives
This is a real-time chat app with Firebase's firestore. I made this app along with [one of tutorial of codingthesmartway.com](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/building-a-real-time-chat-application-with-vue-js-and-firebase-part-1-670c768ad860) with a week time frame to experience Vue framework. 
For faster load and scalability, the enviroment was changed to Vue3, and Tailwind instead of Vue2, Bootstrap, and JQuery.
